    <h1>About Me</title></h1>
    <h2>Ryan Jones</h2>
    <p> I am 18 years old and the degree/career path i'm takng is computer science.
        I love to read and watch shows and chill. Mostly with family and friends, I 
        I like to spend time with them.</p>
    <p>  I am pursueing my career now by doing online 
        school while doing job, I think its working. The thing I love most by Byu-Idaho
        is the welcoming nature of it, I never feel left out. idk which degree i'm 
        purseing, I think its the 4 years one but I don't know the name. This course
        will help me in my career life because I hope to have a career that is based
        in technology. I also just like learning a lot about technology to use in my 
        daily life</p> 
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jese Christ of latter day saints all my
        life. Ever since I was born, and I see that as a blessing. I'm very good at 
        picking favorites of things. I couldn't pick a favorite quote or scripture,
        a lot of them are good.</p>
    <p> I'm ready to start this course.</p>
