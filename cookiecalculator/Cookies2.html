          No Other Like This
          Here we have a method to figure out what your personal taste buds and taste brain will like. There is no 
          other site like it, and if there is, I’ve never heard of it. A site that will be nice to have on hand were 
          looking this over will be the list of cookies, either that be Wikipedia or google or whatever. That would 
          be nice, I will reference that time from time. So, this will be exciting, if your anything like me I don’t 
          like choices that much and this will ease some stress on my shoulders and hopefully you as well. The great 
          thing as well is that this applies to other things as well, whenever you face a variety of cakes, pies, 
          food, anything. Ask your self these few questions, categories, and then conqueror.
