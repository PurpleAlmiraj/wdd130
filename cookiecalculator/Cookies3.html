            Questions:
            One thing experiments and scientists have studied, is that people don’t like choices or too many choices. 
            That’s because when you make a choice when there are a lot of choices, you think back to that moment and 
            think that something could be better. Accept it, no matter what your choice most likely you will regret 
            it to some degree. That’s something people and we in this exercise must work on so that we don’t regret,
            because regret will ruin our current choice. So having 3-6 options is a good thing to have to choose from. 
            Now we can start making a base line on what will be on that 3-6 cookies line. Almost 100 percent of the 
            time there will be chocolate chip, but then it becomes difficult. There could be oatmeal, snickerdoodle, 
            white chocolate chip, raisins, cranberries, etc., etc. You know the most basic of cookies and have in your 
            mind that those are the cookies that are most likely going to be there, but it will have chocolate chip 
            that’s guaranteed pretty much.
