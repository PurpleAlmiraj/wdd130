            Introduction to Cookies
            This is the site of your dreams. Have you ever looked up how many cookies there are on google? 
            I just checked and there seems to be around 130 of them. And whenever you are around a place with 
            a variety of cookies, there could be a couple to a couple dozens. It’s a struggle because cookies 
            have a lot of calories, you can’t just try them all, that will ruin your diet. Also, its bad food 
            edict, people will think you’re a cookie monster or something. But here you are, I will try to 
            come up with a plan to figure out which cookies to take which the opportunity presents itself to you.
            Because everyone has been in that situation, where you go to a party, banquet, potluck, whatever 
            you want to call it. It has caught us all of guard and then we don’t know what to take. It’s the 
            same thing as when you try to choose Mary Ann’s Ice cream, Sea’s candies chocolate, or anything 
            else like that.

            What Site Does? 
            Well, how? I’m sure that’s all you guys are asking, how will I do it. Well first I have a plan; you 
            need to answer some questions first. Think about texture, taste, toppings, all that stuff. Break it 
            down all into a deep deep science that can quantity which one you would like better. That seems like 
            a good idea. One thing to keep in mind in this exercise is that when the opportunity does present to 
            you, realistically there are probably only about 3-6 cookies max in variety. So, it would be such a 
            complicated process as if all 130 types of cookies are all on a dinner table. Your choices are between 
            6 perhaps, and that’s easier.
