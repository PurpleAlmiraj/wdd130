      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My idea for a website is for it be about cookies
        I want my website identify hundreds of cookies and maybe have a method of telling you what cookie you would want, and or recipes. Idk
        Have you ever thought there are too many cookies? Or that too many of them are to out there and are just made for the idea and people aren’t trying to make them good? Well, here you can figure out if you like them or not. 
        It may not seem practical, but everyone ever has been struggling with choosing things in the past, and cookies are no exception. When cookies are presented to you, you have chocolate chip, snickerdoodle, and a dozen more choices. And you are overwhelmed but no longer. 
        
        Feedback.
        What does your website do?
        How does it help people?
        Doesn’t seem practical 
        Idk how a website can do this.

        Introduction to Cookies
        This is the site of your dreams. Have you ever looked up how many cookies there are on google? 
        I just checked and there seems to be around 130 of them. And whenever you are around a place with 
        a variety of cookies, there could be a couple to a couple dozens. It’s a struggle because cookies 
        have a lot of calories, you can’t just try them all, that will ruin your diet. Also, its bad food 
        edict, people will think you’re a cookie monster or something. But here you are, I will try to 
        come up with a plan to figure out which cookies to take which the opportunity presents itself to you.
        Because everyone has been in that situation, where you go to a party, banquet, potluck, whatever 
        you want to call it. It has caught us all of guard and then we don’t know what to take. It’s the 
        same thing as when you try to choose Mary Ann’s Ice cream, Sea’s candies chocolate, or anything 
        else like that.  

       What Site Does? 
       Well, how? I’m sure that’s all you guys are asking, how will I do it. Well first I have a plan; you 
       need to answer some questions first. Think about texture, taste, toppings, all that stuff. Break it 
       down all into a deep deep science that can quantity which one you would like better. That seems like 
       a good idea. One thing to keep in mind in this exercise is that when the opportunity does present to 
       you, realistically there are probably only about 3-6 cookies max in variety. So, it would be such a 
       complicated process as if all 130 types of cookies are all on a dinner table. Your choices are between 
       6 perhaps, and that’s easier.

      </ul>
      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
         Questions:
         One thing experiments and scientists have studied, is that people don’t like choices or too many choices. 
         That’s because when you make a choice when there are a lot of choices, you think back to that moment and 
         think that something could be better. Accept it, no matter what your choice most likely you will regret 
         it to some degree. That’s something people and we in this exercise must work on so that we don’t regret,
         because regret will ruin our current choice. So having 3-6 options is a good thing to have to choose from. 
         Now we can start making a base line on what will be on that 3-6 cookies line. Almost 100 percent of the 
         time there will be chocolate chip, but then it becomes difficult. There could be oatmeal, snickerdoodle, 
         white chocolate chip, raisins, cranberries, etc., etc. You know the most basic of cookies and have in your 
         mind that those are the cookies that are most likely going to be there, but it will have chocolate chip 
         that’s guaranteed pretty much.

        No Other Like This
	      Here we have a method to figure out what your personal taste buds and taste brain will like. There is no 
        other site like it, and if there is, I’ve never heard of it. A site that will be nice to have on hand were 
        looking this over will be the list of cookies, either that be Wikipedia or google or whatever. That would 
        be nice, I will reference that time from time. So, this will be exciting, if your anything like me I don’t 
        like choices that much and this will ease some stress on my shoulders and hopefully you as well. The great 
        thing as well is that this applies to other things as well, whenever you face a variety of cakes, pies, 
        food, anything. Ask your self these few questions, categories, and then conqueror.
