            Hello this is where we talk about riviers. We have great rivers for vacationing personals. We have Falling Bear, Falling Snake, Flying bird, and Cruse.
            Each of these have very different aspects of them that will be mentionsed. But first, in order to go down or explore and have fun in these rivers, 
            please remember to go to the river's verification booth, right next to the big sign and icecream shop. We need to know that you are verified to go down 
            so we don't have any people who shouldn't be there and all that stuff. But remember, pack your sunscreen.

            Falling bear is a side river that goes south into the main Tuskin River. It has been known to have bears wondering about
            to keep on the look out for that. but besides that it can get kind of fast and rough. Stay in your boats and have a blast
            </div>
            <div class="box2">
            The Falling Snake river is also a side river that flows into the Tuskin river, its called Falling Snake river because its 
            known to be the longest and to be the most curvy. If you just want a relaxing long ride, this river is your guy.
            </div>
            <div class="box3">
            Falling bird like the others is a river that goes into the Tuskin river. the unique thing about this one is the birds. 
            There is an great view of birds, the trees there have a huge bird colony and sometimes they fall ontop of people. Not 
            sure why but thats the case. But for boaters, this one is in the midpoint of Bear and Snake, where its not to fast or slow
            its around perfect for viewing and peaceful pleasure. 
            </div>
            <div class="box4">
            The last rivier Cruse actually does not go into the Tuskin river, it goes into the Ocean. While on this rivier, make sure to 
            keep a look out for the place to get off, there are peple to help. But its an entirely different experience from Snake or Bear,
            you name it. But you can also get to the Ocean from that rivier if you want, takes about 3-4 hours.
